# Software Workflow Introduction
Learn to use GitHub, Python, and the Mechatronics team's workflow!

## Getting started
If this is your first time here on the GitHub, welcome! Please refer to the Python environment setup below followed by the Git guide to get started with your introduction to our team's workflow.

### Python environment setup
[Get started our Python setup guide here](src/python_setup_guide.md)

### Using Git
[See our Git Guide here](src/git_guide.md)

### Introduce yourself
For your first task, you'll write some basic Python hello world code using Pycharm or the Python environment you set up on your local machine and then push it to this repository. Please do `git checkout first-task` or, in Pycharm, right-click on the `first-task` branch and then click "Checkout". Your instructions for how to submit will be in the docstring in the top of the file `submissions/template.py`. If you want help, you can checkout the `submission-ireichard` branch to see what my own submission looks like. You can also message us in the Discord. Good luck!

## Projects
If you're writing up a project and have already done the first task, please refer to our project list Trello board and read the styling guide before you begin developing.

### Styling guide
[See our Styling Guide here](src/styling_guide.md) before writing any Python code for projects.
