Followed this tutorial on how to transfer files between python files: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27qfn3Gco00&list=LL&index=5&t=639s



Followed this tutorial to learn how to create a log file with logging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ARI4Cz-awo&list=LL&index=6&t=453s



Searched up python random number generator functions to then use the random.randrange() function



With the log tutorial the log file is automatically created which then means that I simply need

to log the random number that is created by the random.randrange() function and send that test.log file.

I also learned through the log tutorial that one can embed the date and time in which the log was created

within the log function using the logging.basicConfig() format configuration.
