"""Introduce yourself to the Mechatronics team by coding in Python!
***USE GIT TO MAKE A NEW BRANCH***
Please refer to our git guide for how to do this. The branch should be called `submission-[your name]`,
where [your name] should be your first initial of your first name and then your last name, all lowercase.
***RENAME THIS FILE***
This file's name should be your first initial of your first name and then your last name, all lowercase.
Goal:
Modify this file to print out the following:
1. Your name, year, major
2. A hobby you like and something interesting about yourself
3. What your goals are for Mechatronics
After you've tested and verified your code works, push it to the remote repository on a new branch.
***IMPORTANT***
To finish this task, you need to now push it to GitHub.
After you push the code to your own branch, on the GitHub, go `[n] branches`, find your branch, and submit
a Pull Request to the "introduction-submission" branch. Once that's been approved you're done! congrats!
