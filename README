Introduction
Hello my name is Jackson Keus and I am a third year computer science student. I joined this club to see what it is like to work with robots. I am looking forward to meeting all of you.

Description
First thing is to download all of the folder and files in this branch into a folder. This folder will be your workstation. 
Once you have this you should follow these steps:

How to use

1. Open two terminals, one to run the timepublisher node and the other to run the timesubscriber node

2. In each terminal run the following comands
	
		cd <name_workstation_folder>
	
	#going to root of the program
    
		rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro foxy -y
	
	#this is to make sure you have the required dependancies
    
		. install/setup.bash
	
	#run this because that is what it says in the foxy documentation
    
		colcon build --packages-select py_pubsub
	
	#builds our package for use

3. Now chose which terminal should be which node
	a. In the terminal where you want the timepublisher run
	
		ros2 run py_pubsub timepublihser
		
	b. In the other terminal where timesubscirber will be run
	
		ros2 run py_pubsub timesubscriber
		
4. Give it 5 seconds to run and it should work. It will work every 5 seconds

Extra notes
Also in the workspace folder is a REAMDE file and a file called workingScreenshot. The screenshot is of my vm running the both nodes.
The nodes are communicating the epoch unix time with eachother and printing it out accordingly.
