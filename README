How to use

Assuming that you have ros2 foxy and colcom installed

1. Open two terminals, one to run the timepublisher node and the other to run the timesubscriber node

2. In each terminal run the following comands
	a. cd IntroWorkSpaceJacksonKeus
		going to root of the program
	b. rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro foxy -y
		this is to make sure you have the required dependancies
	c. . install/setup.bash
		run this because that is what it says in the foxy documentation
	d. colcon build --packages-select py_pubsub
		build our packages for use

3. Now chose which terminal should be which node
	a. In the terminal where you want the timepublisher run
		ros2 run py_pubsub timepublihser
		
	b. In the other terminal where timesubscirber will be run
		ros2 run py_pubsub timesubscriber
		
4. Give it 5 seconds to run and it should work. It will work every 5 seconds
